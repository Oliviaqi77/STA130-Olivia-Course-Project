    "Introduction:\n",
    "This project explores the relationships between social connection, community engagement, and various aspects of well-being using data from the Canadian Social Connection Survey (CSCS). By analyzing the CSCS data, I aim to uncover insights that could help emphasize the importance of social connections for personal and community health. Below, I propose three distinct analyses, each designed to explore different aspects of social well-being and connection."
